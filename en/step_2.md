In this step, you'll learn:
+ How to use the dictionary in Wolfram
+ How to structure input in order to get results

In Wolfram, the command `DictionaryLookup` finds words in the dictionary. You can look up words in many different languages.

You can use `DictonaryLookup` to create a list of words that match a specific pattern. For example, you could create a list of words in English (the default language) that start with "ab" and have four letters.

Or you could create a list of all the words which start with "c", have "t" as the third letter, and are four letters long.
