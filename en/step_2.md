## Using the Dictionary

--- task ---
If you have never used the Wolfram Language before, follow [this guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-mathematica) to get started and learn to use the tool. You'll need to look at **Starting Mathematica** and **Programming in Mathematica**.

In this step, you'll learn how to use the dictionary in Wolfram, and how you need to structure your input in order to get results.

In Wolfram, we can use `DictionaryLookup` to find words in the dictionary. We can look up words in many different languages.

We can use `DictonaryLookup` to find a list of words which match a specific pattern. For example, we could find a list of the words in English, (the default language), which start with "ab" and have 4 letters.

Or we could find a list of all the words which start with "c", have "t" as the third letter, and are 4 letters in total.

Use Wolfram to complete these words:

  + h_ll_o 
  + r_s_ber_y
  + v_ca_ul_ry
